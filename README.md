# How to install

First time to install dotfiles.
* sh install.sh -i

Update dotfiles
* sh install.sh

Auto install vim plugins
* sh install -p



## Install Font

The bashrc will use powerline font, so you have to install this font by yourselves. The font is on the dir "assets", called "Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline.otf".

* assets/Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline.otf


On the other side, I suggest you to install a pretty font called "PT Mono".
* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono

How to let these two font exist on the terminal?
In software iTerm2, you can open it's preferences interface and change the regular font to be "PT Mono" and the Non-ASCII font to be "Powerline symbols"

## customized

* Add file .bash_customzied
* Add file .alias_customized
